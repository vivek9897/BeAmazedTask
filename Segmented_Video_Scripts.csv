0,"Embarrassingly Dumb Ways People Died [Part 8] We’d all like to be remembered for something great. But, surprisingly often, incredibly dumb",Video A
1,"folks leave this world with a parting tale they’d probably prefer to be forgotten. That said, some of these spectacularly dim-witted,",Video A
2,"accidental exit strategies are irresistibly entertaining to hear about. So, without further ado, let’s check out some of the most Embarrassingly",Video A
3,"Dumb Ways People Died. Labels? What Labels? Whenever blowtorches fall into the hands of the less-than-brightest members of our species, it’s",Video A
4,"always best to take a few steps back. By which I mean, move to the next county over. If this piece",Video A
5,"of common sense wasn’t already obvious, a man from Topeka, Kansas certainly made it clear in June 2019. When he stumbled",Video A
6,"upon what appeared to be an empty metal drum, the inquisitive fellow thought best to cut the thing open with a",Video A
7,"blowtorch. What he was hoping to use the divided drum for is anyone’s guess, as it exploded violently before the fellow",Video A
8,"got the chance to finish his task. Apparently, he’d ignored the bold warnings that the drum contained methanol, a highly volatile",Video A
9,"compound. For people like this, instructions to ‘keep away from naked flame’ must sound like a challenge! The only reward, of",Video A
10,"course, is a Darwin Award for removing yourself from the gene pool. Whether he read the labels or not, this guy’s",Video A
11,"over-eager blowtorch trigger-finger cost him his life. Disney’s Other Dumbo In Disney’s Beauty and the Beast, Gaston is an incredibly arrogant",Video A
12,"character with an endless supply of misplaced self-confidence. So, perhaps the man who played the role of Gaston at Disney World",Video A
13,"Orlando was still in-character when he brought about his own, explosive demise in 2015? It would seem so, because he clearly",Video A
14,placed too much confidence in the strength of his own skull when he launched a firework from atop his head. He’d,Video A
15,"been drinking and joking around with the idea, when the firework accidentally caught alight. Within seconds, the mortar tube exploded in",Video A
16,"a colourful, fiery explosion that no amount of beer could take the edge off. Needless to say, Disney World had to",Video A
17,"find a new Gaston, but hopefully the new one was less of a method actor. Stay In Your Lane Riding in",Video A
18,"a bicycle lane can be dangerous enough sometimes, but riding a bicycle on a highway? For most people, this obvious no-no",Video A
19,"should speak for itself. But one man in September 2019 was clearly different from ‘most people’, as he decided to take",Video A
20,"a late-night bike ride along the 405 Freeway in Long Beach, California. He trundled along in the auxiliary lane – which",Video A
21,"is designed to allow drivers to speed up or slow down – on the 60mph highway in the dark, unaware of",Video A
22,"the danger. Unsurprisingly, a driver using the auxiliary lane, not expecting to see a cyclist, ploughed into the bicycle at full-speed,",Video A
23,"unable to stop. The cyclist was killed, and the driver was traumatised by an accident that should never have happened. So,",Video A
24,"unless you’re a superhuman who can ride their bicycle at 60mph and over, leave the highways to the motorists. Boredom Cure",Video A
25,"When you’re prone to outrageously-bad decisions, tempting fate is about twice as dumb as it is for regular people. That didn’t",Video A
26,"stop a Brazilian student, though, whose Facebook bio proudly proclaimed the infinitely-wise proverb: ‘better to die from vodka than from boredom’.",Video A
27,"He put that adage to the test at a drinking contest in 2015, when he slammed 25 shots of vodka in",Video A
28,"less than 60 seconds. Shortly after sinking the final one, the student said he felt ill and collapsed. On the way",Video A
29,"to the hospital, he died of alcohol poisoning. Even over an hour, that many shots could’ve been potentially deadly, but in",Video A
30,a minute? Forget about it. It’s fair to say anyone who was cheering this guy on is just as dumb as,Video A
31,"he was. Past Your Bedtime We’re often reminded of how important a good night’s sleep is, and for good reason! But",Video A
32,the impact of staying up too late went far beyond feeling groggy the next morning for one Chinese fellow in 2014.,Video A
33,"As a huge soccer fan, losing sleep during the World Cup due to the 11-hour time difference between host nation Brazil",Video A
34,"and his own was no biggie. But the stress, exhaustion and excitement of watching soccer’s greatest players go head-to-head, non-stop for",Video A
35,the 48-hour stretch he stayed awake for took its toll. His extreme exhaustion is thought to have triggered a brain haemorrhage,Video A
36,"– something research suggests sleep deprivation significantly increases the chances of. He died shortly after the last match of the day,",Video A
37,when Costa Rica defeated Uruguay 3-1. Whether he was a fan of the losing side and took the loss particularly –,Video A
38,"and fatally – hard, is unclear. But if my parents had told me I could die from staying up too late,",Video A
39,"I probably would’ve got more sleep as a teenager! Calamity Convoy One night in April 2016, a truly bizarre convoy was",Video A
40,"seen chugging along a road in Louisiana. One man was driving a sit-down lawnmower, while another sat upon the hood, and",Video A
41,"a third sat in a wheelchair, holding onto the back, being pulled along. The trio was reportedly having the time of",Video A
42,"their lives on their ride along a busy road… that is, until a truck smashed into them from behind. As shocking",Video A
43,"as it seems, it turned out a darkened roadway wasn’t the best place for a tagalong DIY joyride. Miraculously, the only",Video A
44,"person to die in the incident was the man behind the wheel of the lawnmower, who had seemingly instigated the ridiculous",Video A
45,activity. Hopefully his friends will keep their mowers firmly on the grass from now on. Shotgun Wedding It’s not my place,Video A
46,"to criticise another culture’s traditions, but… a circle of dancing men, haphazardly firing shotguns into the air doesn’t seem like the",Video A
47,"smartest way to celebrate a wedding. Unfortunately, that was the method of choice for a group of Indian wedding attendees with",Video A
48,a taste for celebratory gunfire in 2019. The first round of gunshots - fired dangerously closely over the dancers’ heads -,Video A
49,"almost deafened several of them. But the next round, fired without any regard to things like, oh I don’t know… aiming…",Video A
50,"resulted in one shotgun-wielding guest receiving a direct hit to the face. Unaware, the oblivious reveller continued to gleefully fire shots",Video A
51,"until he was made aware of what he’d done. Needless to say, after he’d finally decided to look around him, the",Video A
52,"festivities were over. From now on, how about we stick to wedding bells rather than shotgun shells, eh? Premature Detonation Every",Video A
53,"master criminal has to start with the smaller jobs before the big bucks come along. That said, robbing a machine full",Video A
54,"of condoms for its contents and cash isn’t exactly the usual mark of a criminal genius in-the-making. But on Christmas Day,",Video A
55,"2015, a group of amateur German thieves decided it was time to make headway in the crime game. They bundled some",Video A
56,"explosives into a condom dispenser and lit her up. But to their surprise, the explosion blasted chunks of the metal enclosure",Video A
57,outwards with enough speed to become deadly projectiles. One of the rubber-robbers was struck in the head and died shortly afterwards.,Video A
58,"The machine wasn’t in a much better state, either. I hate to state the obvious, but I really think that condom-crazy",Video A
59,"criminal would’ve been okay if he’d just worn protection. Cold-Blooded Companions For many people, the idea of having a snake in",Video A
60,"their house is nightmare fuel. For others, a snake is an ideal pet. For a woman living in Indiana in 2019,",Video A
61,"though, one snake wasn’t enough. Her ideal number wasn’t 2, or 3… it was 140. As an enthusiast and part-time breeder,",Video A
62,you’d think the 36-year-old would’ve had a solid understanding of the risks of living with reptiles that have the ability to,Video A
63,"kill you. But whether she let her guard down, or just felt comfortable letting the creatures roam free, one fateful evening",Video A
64,"saw one of her snakes turn on its owner. The next day, the town sheriff was horrified to discover the reptile",Video A
65,enthusiast held in a deadly embrace by one of her beloved pets; an 8-foot-long python. It had strangled her to death,Video A
66,"hours before, but was still wrapped around her neck, proving that when a python wants a hug, there are no half-measures.",Video A
67,"Pythons… Just. Say. No. Look Ma – No Hands! Of all the times to show off, doing so while cruising on",Video A
68,a motorbike at 85mph is undoubtedly among the stupidest. That didn’t stop one Russian motorbike blogger who fancied himself somewhat of,Video A
69,"a daredevil on his Harley Davidson in June 2019. He raced along, using his feet to steer while filming with his",Video A
70,"hands, bragging about how his ability to not give a [beep] made these kinds of stunts possible. Mere moments after sending",Video A
71,"the outrageously dangerous video on to a friend, the biker lost control, and his Harley flipped dozens of times, smashing against",Video A
72,"the tarmac. The vehicle ended up only slightly less mangled than its rider did, but even the most skilled mechanics and",Video A
73,"doctors combined couldn’t put the two back together. Texting and riding is dumb enough, but if you follow in this guy’s",Video A
74,"footsteps, the only thing waiting down the road is a tarmac-covered Darwin Award. Heads Up! Bumping your head is one of",Video A
75,the most rage-inducing minor pains a person can sustain. But even a direct smack into the hardest low-hanging shelf doesn’t compare,Video A
76,to what one daredevil with a taste for trains and trespassing went through in North Carolina in 2018. In an attempt,Video A
77,"to satisfy his adrenaline cravings, he climbed onto a train’s roof and, as if it was a wild, metal stallion, attempted",Video A
78,"to ride it. It went well initially; he’d been issued warnings previously for similar incidents, so he probably had his head",Video A
79,around the balancing-act train-top-cruising required. But his head ended up around something else when the train passed under a low-hanging bridge.,Video A
80,"Apparently not seeing the bridge in time, he hit it at full speed and, it turns out, hitting solid objects at",Video A
81,"around 90mph isn’t very good for the human body. 2 months later, his skull was found on the side of the",Video A
82,"railroad, approximately 128 miles from the stop where his body was found on the day of the accident. This led authorities",Video A
83,"to a grisly conclusion. He’d been – quite literally – decapitated the moment he hit the roof of bridge, and his",Video A
84,body had continued along its journey before eventually falling off the train. The conclusion is simple: don’t be a train cowboy,Video A
85,– it’s a real headache. Bad Time For A Stroll Drive-thru Safari Parks are a great way for anyone with a,Video A
86,"love for nature’s wildest beasts to experience them up-close, safely. Well, it’s safe just as long as you follow one simple",Video A
87,"rule: stay inside your vehicle at all times. But on a summer’s day in 2016 at Badaling Safari World in Beijing,",Video A
88,that simple rule was broken in an act of overwhelming stupidity. After an argument broke out between a passenger and driver,Video A
89,"of a car driving through the tiger enclosure, the passenger stormed out of the car in frustration. Bad move. Within seconds,",Video A
90,"a tiger leapt over and snatched her off in its jaws. But while this was indeed a mind-numbingly stupid decision, the",Video A
91,response of the other occupants of the car is what proved deadly. Despite the fact that park officials were already merely,Video A
92,"feet away on their rescue mission, one passenger decided she’d be able to overpower the tiger herself. So, she got out,",Video A
93,"ran over… and was immediately killed by one of nature’s most efficient murder-machines. Ironically, the person she’d aimed to save survived,",Video A
94,"and if she’d only waited a second for the highly-trained park officials to take over, she could’ve too. It shouldn’t need",Video A
95,"to be said, but if you’re going to fight a tiger unarmed, you’re going to lose. Together Forever Of all the",Video A
96,"ways to go, passing away while doing the dirty is probably one of the best. But for an elderly man who",Video A
97,"hired an escort in 2016, the aftermath was where the real embarrassment lay. Unfortunately, in the heat of passion, the man",Video A
98,"suffered a heart-attack and died, much to his paid companion’s horror. But to make matters worse, the combination of the escort’s",Video A
99,"panic, and the man’s no-longer-circulated blood-flow, the pair became… well… stuck. Unable to break free from the horrifically morbid embrace, the woman had no choice but to seek medical assistance. After paramedics picked her up, she was wheeled past crowds of hospital onlookers under a blanket; still very much attached to the man she’d given a very happy ending to. I guess the whole ‘parting’ bit of ‘til death do us part’ only applies to married couples. Which of these dumb demises raised your eyebrows highest? Let me know in the comments section below and stay tuned for more! Thanks for watching.",Video A
0,"When Charles Darwin developed his Theory of Evolution he discovered animals bred selectively, so the strongest and fittest of the species were",Video B
1,more likely to mate and pass on their DNA. Darwin called this Natural Selection. But every day people do stuff so stupid,Video B
2,"they actually die, and so no longer have the ability to pass their DNA to future generations. Long after he died, the",Video B
3,Darwin Awards were created as a tongue in cheek way to remember those people who have removed themselves from humanity through their,Video B
4,"own stupidity. Coming up, are the top 20 dumbest of the dumb Darwin Award winners. 20. LIVEWIRE When inmate Michael Godwin had",Video B
5,"his death penalty commuted to a life sentence, he was grateful to be able to walk away from death row. But it",Video B
6,"seems that karma had other plans. One night in 1989, he discovered the television in his cell was broken and, deciding to",Video B
7,"fix it himself, embarked on a little DIY. Foolishly, he thought it would be a great idea to use his teeth instead",Video B
8,"of a wire cutter. Biting down on a live wire he electrocuted himself, not helped by the fact he was sitting on",Video B
9,"a metal toilet at the time. Godwin may have escaped the electric chair, but it seems destiny was intent on seeing him",Video B
10,"die by electrocution. 19. AIRLESS AIRHEAD When a Brazilian farmer discovered a bee hive on his property in 2002, he knew precisely",Video B
11,two things. Bees could sting and they needed to be removed with fire. No one knows why he decided that fire was,Video B
12,his best option. All we do know is that he fashioned a makeshift helmet from a plastic bag to save himself from,Video B
13,"both the smoke and the bee stings. But besides all his careful planning, he didn't bother to think that he might have",Video B
14,"to breathe, and failed to poke air holes into the plastic bag. When he didn't return home, his wife set out to",Video B
15,"find him and soon discovered him suffocated beneath the beehive. He was untouched by the bees, though. 18. CHIMNEY GRENADE One afternoon",Video B
16,"in 2005, Marko decided to clean the chimney in his workshop. But when he tried to use a simple broom, he realized",Video B
17,"it was too small for the job. Clearly, he had to improvise. He decided what he needed was a chain to pull",Video B
18,"the broom through the chimney and a heavy object to weigh it down. Looking in his workshop, he thought he’d found the",Video B
19,"perfect thing, a grenade. All he had to do now was weld it to the broom and chain. Except he failed to",Video B
20,"think about what could happen as he switched on his welding equipment. As soon as the flame met the grenade, it exploded",Video B
21,"- killing him instantly. The chimney, however, was left completely untouched by the blast. 17. BEHIND ENEMA LINES Texan shop owner Michael",Video B
22,"was an alcoholic, but not an ordinary one. Due to a painful throat condition, he couldn’t drink through his mouth. This meant",Video B
23,he had to find other ways to consume his liquor and his wife said he soon became addicted to enemas. This popular,Video B
24,"method is far more dangerous, as alcohol is absorbed directly through the capillaries in the rectum. So, one night he wanted to",Video B
25,get blind drunk and decided the only way to do it was to pour a hundred fluid ounces of sherry up his,Video B
26,"rear end. What he didn't know was that after he’d passed out, the alcohol kept absorbing and he was dead by the",Video B
27,morning. The toxicology report stated he had a blood alcohol level of 0.47% - meaning he'd pretty much embalmed himself. 16. PARKING,Video B
28,"BRAKE FAIL When we're constantly reminded to recycle, plastic bags can be a source of annoyance. So, when a 58-year old Australian",Video B
29,"woman was driving to the grocery store and thought she’d forgotten her plastic bags, she promptly stopped her car to check the",Video B
30,"trunk. If she was more worried about her parking than she was about grocery bags, she would have remembered to put the",Video B
31,"handbrake on. As she checked the trunk, the car began rolling backward, crushing her to death. Somehow, she managed to run herself",Video B
32,"over. 15. EAResponsible A Romanian man in 2002 decided he would skip checking the local train schedules and instead, deduce if the",Video B
33,"train was coming through the powers of his ears alone. Lying on the railway line, he pressed his ears to the tracks",Video B
34,"to hear if the train was approaching. Clearly, his hearing wasn't all he thought it was because he never heard it. He",Video B
35,was hit by an oncoming express train and died immediately. 14. Lava La Vida Loca Don't you just hate it when your,Video B
36,"lava lamp doesn't heat up quickly enough? Well, twenty-four year old Philip did. After plugging in his lava lamp and waiting a",Video B
37,"few minutes, he was disappointed to see that nothing was happening. Eager to get it working, he decided to speed up the",Video B
38,process by placing it on a hot stove. But with the contents of a lava lamp only being designed to withstand temperatures,Video B
39,"of up to 40 degrees, it quickly overheated and exploded. Poor Philip was killed when the glass from the lamp shattered and",Video B
40,penetrated his heart. Not so groovy. 13. UNDER PRESSURE Two bored comrades in a Romanian aluminium factory decided to have some fun,Video B
41,"with an air hose usually used for industrial machinery. When blowing dust off their clothes became boring, they cranked things up a",Video B
42,notch and decided to remove their clothes entirely. Things quickly moved below the belt when one of the guys decided he was,Video B
43,going to see what happened when he pumped six bars of atmospheric pressure into his anus. Not only did he break employment,Video B
44,"regulations, but he also broke right through his intestinal tract and he died within minutes from severe internal hemoerraghing. 12. DANGER ZONE",Video B
45,"In 2017 two United States Navy pilots got a little too carried away with Top Gun, when they decided to completely abandon",Video B
46,safety regulations to perform daredevil-ish stunts. Reaching astonishing speeds while flying as low as 210 feet – a good 300 feet below,Video B
47,their minimum permitted altitude - things were bound to take a downward turn as they swapped controls back and forth. Descending too,Video B
48,"low and slow, one of the pilots traded off controls to his co-pilot, but it was too late….The T-45C Goshawk crashed before",Video B
49,"they could safely eject themselves. Instructing pilot Lt Burch was fond of the phrase, “There are old pilots and there are bold",Video B
50,pilots.” He failed to mention there are also outrageously dumb ones. 11. CRUISE CONTROL The fastest human can run over 27 miles,Video B
51,"per hour, but that’s only after accelerating during a run-up. A Dutch teenager in 2004 thought he could do better than that",Video B
52,"and get close to that speed straight away. In a bid to impress his friends, he set his car to cruise control",Video B
53,at 20mph and told them he was going to jump out and run alongside the car before jumping back in and driving,Video B
54,away. But his shocked friends could only look on as he stepped out the moving car and immediately smashed his head on,Video B
55,"the tarmac. He died the following day. 10. TREASURE HUNT Described as the world's largest treasure hunt, the Geocashing app allows people",Video B
56,"follow online clues to find small treasure boxes, knows as geocaches, hidden in their area. Sounds like harmless fun until someone decides",Video B
57,"to head down a flooded waterway in search of trinkets. When meteorologists warned the Czech Republic of impending rainstorms, most people paid",Video B
58,attention. But not this group of Geocachers who thought it would be clever to climb into an underground waterworks tunnel. Although two,Video B
59,"members of the group survived, two others were swept away with one young man still reported missing. 9. DYING FOR A SMOKE",Video B
60,"Nobody likes long bus journeys. They're cramped and boring, not to mention you're basically sharing a tin can with dozens of strangers",Video B
61,and their farts. One Scottish woman especially hated the idea of spending twelve hours stuck on a coach from Glasgow to London,Video B
62,without a cigarette. Passengers reported that she grew increasingly agitated and watched in horror as she began throwing herself at the passenger,Video B
63,door. The bus was traveling at 60mph when she tumbled out into the road before falling under the wheels of the bus.,Video B
64,"Smoking really does kill. 8. FOOTREST Most people go to the movies to see the drama unfold on the screen, not beside",Video B
65,"them. When a local man booked tickets in the VIP area of the cinema complex, he was hoping for a good time.",Video B
66,"What he got instead was a ticket to the Darwin Awards. After dropping his phone beneath his seat, he tried to retrieve",Video B
67,"it - only to get his head wedged inside the footrest. If this wasn't bad enough, he then suffered a cardiac arrest",Video B
68,"and died in hospital. 7. VICTORIA FALLS 50 year old Michael was a clever man. Not only was he a college headmaster,",Video B
69,"he was also a respected geography lecturer on the conferences circuit. While on a trip to the Victoria Falls bridge, he was",Video B
70,happily taking photos of his girlfriend when he dropped his glasses over the edge. Thinking he wouldn't be able to enjoy the,Video B
71,"view of the glorious Victoria Falls without them, he tried to retrieve them - only to fall 40 ft to his death.",Video B
72,"6. KILLER WHALE BONE This historic entry into the Darwin Awards sees another clever man, Founding Father of the USA, Gouverneur Morris",Video B
73,"come to an untimely end through an eye-watering DIY medical procedure. When Morris began suffering from a blockage in his urethra, he",Video B
74,"took matters into his own hands. Inserting a whalebone into his urethra, all he managed to do was give himself a deadly",Video B
75,"infection. He died November 6, 1816 – probably feeling silly. 5. DISTRACTED DRIVER 58-year old Clifford Jones was driving without a seatbelt.",Video B
76,"He was also driving without pants. When a regular drive just wasn't interesting enough, he decided to watch a bit of... adult",Video B
77,content on his phone and have some fun. If only he’d kept his hands on the wheel. With the blood rushing away,Video B
78,"from his head, he grew increasingly distracted and lost control of his car. As it crashed, he hurtled through the sunroof and",Video B
79,"died on impact. 4. Posing With A Grenade Faking a smile, posing with angry animals, posing with a primed grenade… all things",Video B
80,"people will do for attention online… Yes, you heard me right. In 2017, Alexander 'Sasha' Chechik from Russia pulled the pin out",Video B
81,of a hand grenade whilst in his car and posted photographs of himself holding it to his girlfriend; probably as a way,Video B
82,to show of his balls of brainless steel. A source who spoke to the Russian news service reporting the incident said: ‘’the,Video B
83,guy didn’t manage to insert the hand grenade pin back in.’’ The pin is the safety mechanism. Its the lever on the,Video B
84,"side is the firing mechanism that activates the grenade when released. However, its still not worth risking it by removing the pin.",Video B
85,"Police categorised his death as an accident, not suicide, as they believed he thought it wouldn’t explode as long as he didn’t",Video B
86,throw it. 3. Bear Selfie Prabhu Bhatara from India was on his way home from a wedding when he spotted a black,Video B
87,"bear. Seeing this as a great photo opportunity, he got close to the bear, and attempted to take a selfie with it.",Video B
88,"As he did, the bear mauled him. He died shortly after due to his injuries. My advice: stay far away from bears.",Video B
89,"They may be cute, but if you photograph them at an angle that makes them look fat, its game over. 2. SAWING",Video B
90,INTO A GRENADE Two pathologists at a German symposium dinner told the tale of a man who stumbled across a World War,Video B
91,"2 grenade. Instead of staying well clear, he wanted to open it up to see how it worked. Back home, he placed",Video B
92,it inside a vice and tried to saw it perfectly in half. The saw detonated the grenade and the man died from,Video B
93,"a fatal head injury. Upon post-mortem, it was discovered there was very little brain matter left inside his skull. Although the two",Video B
94,"pathologists joked that there couldn't have been much to start with. Before we get to our number 1 dumbest Darwin Award, here",Video B
95,are a few Honourable Mentions. There’s this man who planked on a Tiger – there’s no way he walked away from that,Video B
96,"one. Then there’s this guy who bit a tiger’s tail – wait is that the same guy? Poor tiger! Oh, and this",Video B
97,"woman who got something stuck in her handgun. Nice. Ok, so back to the final award in our countdown! 1. Smokin' Hot!",Video B
98,Gary Banning from North Carolina was at his friend's house when he spotted a mysterious jar of tasty looking liquid. Assuming it,Video B
99,"was hot sauce, and without bothering to check, he flipped off the lid and started to drink it. But he soon discovered it wasn't hot sauce at all - but a jar of gasoline. The shock of chugging gasoline was too much for Gary so he spat it out, then tried to calm down with a cigarette. As soon as he lit it, he caught fire and died the next day from his injuries. So which of these Darwin Award Winners do you think is the dumbest? Let me know in the comments!",Video B

3,know I have – especially when clothing is optional. Maybe this was what Colin Scott was thinking when he strayed off the trail,Video C

13,they deserve. Especially big ones. Cambodian military policeman Khim Sakhorn – nicknamed “Big Giant” – got exactly that when he tried to extort,Video C
14,"money and crystal meth from a local dealer. To scare the dealer, Khim pulled the pin from a grenade. Unsurprisingly, this tactic worked,",Video C

87,"a firm position in the at-risk Darwin award survivors club. That’s just no place for a chainsaw, joke or",Video E
88,not. The final at-risk survivor is this fellow who let rage overcome any shred of rational thought. While his,Video E

93,"far away over the horizon. A Bridge Too Far Videogames, movies and TV shows have led us all to",Video E
94,believe that clearing a rising drawbridge in a car is a viable feat. It isn’t. But that realisation never,Video E
95,occurred to a couple of wannabe Texan stuntmen who put their inflated senses of their own abilities to the,Video E

Because the majority, like our Texan friends, follow a learning curve that’s steeper than the downward path of their car. However, any learning was short-lived in this case, as the Texan pair were trapped in their car after it failed to make the jump to the other side. They sank and soon drowned.
